# Two Dimension KD-Tree

KD-Tree in java, just for learning. Including a small app to show the result.

The Algorithm is in KDTree class(./src/Algs.java).

Visualization.jar can be used in following way:

- drag a testpoint file in to the "addfile" button
- use "KNN" spinner(right bottom) to set the k value that represent the number of nearest neighbors.
- click anywhere you wish, and the app will use KDTree.KNN to calculate knn and paint them in red.

## example

here's an example using ./testfile/R1.txt
